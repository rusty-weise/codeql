Sanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing
attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Often,
this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed
hosts.

If a regular expression implements such a check, it is easy to
accidentally make the check too permissive by not escaping the ``.``
meta-characters appropriately. Even if the check is not used in a
security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause
undesirable behaviors when it accidentally succeeds.

Recommendation
--------------

Escape all meta-characters appropriately when constructing regular
expressions for security checks, pay special attention to the ``.``
meta-character.

Example
-------

The following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the
``example.com`` domain, or one of its subdomains.

.. code:: javascript

    app.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {
        let url = req.param('url'),
            host = urlLib.parse(url).host;
        // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker
        let regex = /^((www|beta).)?example.com/;
        if (host.match(regex)) {
            res.redirect(url);
        }
    });

The check is however easy to bypass because the unescaped ``.`` allows
for any character before ``example.com``, effectively allowing the
redirect to go to an attacker-controlled domain such as
``wwwXexample.com``.

Address this vulnerability by escaping ``.`` appropriately:
``let regex = /((www|beta)\.)?example\.com/``.
