Directly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without
validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks,
unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very
similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled
by the attacker.

Recommendation
--------------

To guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid
putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a
list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list
based on the user input provided.

Example
-------

The following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used
directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which
facilitates phishing attacks:

.. code:: javascript

    const app = require("express")();

    app.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {
      // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect
      res.redirect(req.param("target"));
    });

One way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a
known fixed string before doing the redirection:

.. code:: javascript

    const app = require("express")();

    const VALID_REDIRECT = "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html";

    app.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {
      // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string
      let target = req.param("target");
      if (VALID_REDIRECT === target)
        res.redirect(target);
    });
