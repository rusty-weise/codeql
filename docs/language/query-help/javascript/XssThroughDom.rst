Extracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to
a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

A webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and
afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM. Using text from the DOM as
HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any
escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe
sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a
cross-site scripting attack.

Recommendation
--------------

To guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output
encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other
solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.

Example
-------

The following example shows a webpage using a ``data-target`` attribute
to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the
example, the ``data-target`` attribute is read into the ``target``
variable, and the ``$`` function is then supposed to use the ``target``
variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be
manipulated.

.. code:: javascript

    $("button").click(function () {
        var target = $(this).attr("data-target");
        $(target).hide();
    });

However, if an attacker can control the ``data-target`` attribute, then
the value of ``target`` can be used to cause the ``$`` function to
execute arbitary JavaScript.

The above vulnerability can be fixed by using ``$.find`` instead of
``$``. The ``$.find`` function will only interpret ``target`` as a CSS
selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.

.. code:: javascript

    $("button").click(function () {
        var target = $(this).attr("data-target");
        $.find(target).hide();
    });
