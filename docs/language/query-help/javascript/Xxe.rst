Parsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead
to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This type of attack uses
external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry
out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or server-side request forgery.
Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, DoS attacks
are still possible and out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow
attackers to steal sensitive data.

Recommendation
--------------

The easiest way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable external entity
handling when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the
library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of
``libxml``, disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have
explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action needs to be
taken.

Example
-------

The following example uses the ``libxml`` XML parser to parse a string
``xmlSrc``. If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be
vulnerable to an XXE attack, since the parser is invoked with the
``noent`` option set to ``true``:

.. code:: javascript

    const app = require("express")(),
      libxml = require("libxmljs");

    app.post("upload", (req, res) => {
      let xmlSrc = req.body,
        doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc, { noent: true });
    });

To guard against XXE attacks, the ``noent`` option should be omitted or
set to ``false``. This means that no entity expansion is undertaken at
all, not even for standard internal entities such as ``&amp;`` or
``&gt;``. If desired, these entities can be expanded in a separate step
using utility functions provided by libraries such as
`underscore <http://underscorejs.org/#unescape>`__,
`lodash <https://lodash.com/docs/latest#unescape>`__ or
`he <https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he>`__.

.. code:: javascript

    const app = require("express")(),
      libxml = require("libxmljs");

    app.post("upload", (req, res) => {
      let xmlSrc = req.body,
        doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc);
    });
