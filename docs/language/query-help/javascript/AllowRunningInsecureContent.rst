Electron is secure by default through a policy banning the execution of
content loaded over HTTP. Setting the ``allowRunningInsecureContent``
property of a ``webPreferences`` object to ``true`` will disable this
policy.

Enabling the execution of insecure content is strongly discouraged.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not enable the ``allowRunningInsecureContent`` property.

Example
-------

The following example shows ``allowRunningInsecureContent`` being
enabled.

.. code:: javascript

    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
      webPreferences: {
        allowRunningInsecureContent: true
      }
    })

This is problematic, since it allows the execution of code from an
untrusted origin.
