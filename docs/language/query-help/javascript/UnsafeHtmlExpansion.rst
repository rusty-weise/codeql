Sanitizing untrusted input for HTML meta-characters is an important
technique for preventing cross-site scripting attacks. But even a
sanitized input can be dangerous to use if it is modified further before
a browser treats it as HTML. A seemingly innocent transformation that
expands a self-closing HTML tag from ``<div attr="{sanitized}"/>`` to
``<div attr="{sanitized}"></div>`` may in fact cause cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities.

Recommendation
--------------

Use a well-tested sanitization library if at all possible, and avoid
modifying sanitized values further before treating them as HTML.

Example
-------

The following function transforms a self-closing HTML tag to a pair of
open/close tags. It does so for all non-\ ``img`` and non-\ ``area``
tags, by using a regular expression with two capture groups. The first
capture group corresponds to the name of the tag, and the second capture
group to the content of the tag.

.. code:: javascript

    function expandSelfClosingTags(html) {
        var rxhtmlTag = /<(?!img|area)(([a-z][^\w\/>]*)[^>]*)\/>/gi;
        return html.replace(rxhtmlTag, "<$1></$2>"); // BAD
    }

While it is generally known regular expressions are ill-suited for
parsing HTML, variants of this particular transformation pattern have
long been considered safe.

However, the function is not safe. As an example, consider the following
string:

.. code:: html

    <div alt="
    <x" title="/>
    <img src=url404 onerror=alert(1)>"/>

When the above function transforms the string, it becomes a string that
results in an alert when a browser treats it as HTML.

.. code:: html

    <div alt="
    <x" title="></x" >
    <img src=url404 onerror=alert(1)>"/>
