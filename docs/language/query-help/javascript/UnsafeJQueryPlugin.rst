Library plugins, such as those for the jQuery library, are often
configurable through options provided by the clients of the plugin.
Clients, however, do not know the implementation details of the plugin,
so it is important to document the capabilities of each option. The
documentation for the plugin options that the client is responsible for
sanitizing is of particular importance. Otherwise, the plugin may write
user input (for example, a URL query parameter) to a web page without
properly sanitizing it first, which allows for a cross-site scripting
vulnerability in the client application through dynamic HTML
construction.

Recommendation
--------------

Document all options that can lead to cross-site scripting attacks, and
guard against unsafe inputs where dynamic HTML construction is not
intended.

Example
-------

The following example shows a jQuery plugin that selects a DOM element,
and copies its text content to another DOM element. The selection is
performed by using the plugin option ``sourceSelector`` as a CSS
selector.

.. code:: javascript

    jQuery.fn.copyText = function(options) {
        // BAD may evaluate `options.sourceSelector` as HTML
        var source = jQuery(options.sourceSelector),
            text = source.text();
        jQuery(this).text(text);
    }

This is, however, not a safe plugin, since the call to ``jQuery``
interprets ``sourceSelector`` as HTML if it is a string that starts with
``<``.

Instead of documenting that the client is responsible for sanitizing
``sourceSelector``, the plugin can use ``jQuery.find`` to always
interpret ``sourceSelector`` as a CSS selector:

.. code:: javascript

    jQuery.fn.copyText = function(options) {
        // GOOD may not evaluate `options.sourceSelector` as HTML
        var source = jQuery.find(options.sourceSelector),
            text = source.text();
        jQuery(this).text(text);
    }
