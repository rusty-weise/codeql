Replacing a substring with itself has no effect and usually indicates a
mistake, such as misspelling a backslash escape.

Recommendation
--------------

Examine the string replacement to find and correct any typos.

Example
-------

The following code snippet attempts to backslash-escape all double
quotes in ``raw`` by replacing all instances of ``"`` with ``\"``:

.. code:: javascript

    var escaped = raw.replace(/"/g, '\"');

However, the replacement string ``'\"'`` is actually the same as
``'"'``, with ``\"`` interpreted as an identity escape, so the
replacement does nothing. Instead, the replacement string should be
``'\\"'``:

.. code:: javascript

    var escaped = raw.replace(/"/g, '\\"');
