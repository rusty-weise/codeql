Electron is secure by default through a same-origin policy requiring all
JavaScript and CSS code to originate from the machine running the
Electron application. Setting the ``webSecurity`` property of a
``webPreferences`` object to ``false`` will disable the same-origin
policy.

Disabling the same-origin policy is strongly discouraged.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not disable ``webSecurity``.

Example
-------

The following example shows ``webSecurity`` being disabled.

.. code:: javascript

    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
      webPreferences: {
        webSecurity: false
      }
    })

This is problematic, since it allows the execution of insecure code from
other domains.
