Directly evaluating user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter)
as code without properly sanitizing the input first allows an attacker
arbitrary code execution. This can occur when user input is treated as
JavaScript, or passed to a framework which interprets it as an
expression to be evaluated. Examples include AngularJS expressions or
JQuery selectors.

Recommendation
--------------

Avoid including user input in any expression which may be dynamically
evaluated. If user input must be included, use context-specific escaping
before including it. It is important that the correct escaping is used
for the type of evaluation that will occur.

Example
-------

The following example shows part of the page URL being evaluated as
JavaScript code. This allows an attacker to provide JavaScript within
the URL. If an attacker can persuade a user to click on a link to such a
URL, the attacker can evaluate arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of
the user to, for example, steal cookies containing session information.

.. code:: javascript

    eval(document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf("default=")+8))
