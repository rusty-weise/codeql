If a resource descriptor is built using string concatenation, and the
components of the concatenation include user input, a user may be able
to hijack the resource which is loaded.

Recommendation
--------------

If user input must be included in a resource descriptor, it should be
escaped to avoid a malicious user providing special characters that
change the meaning of the descriptor. If possible, use an existing
library to either escape or construct the resource.

For data connections within sub namespaces of ``System.Data``, a
connection builder class is provided. For example, a connection string
which is to be passed to ``System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection`` can be
constructed safely using an instance of
``System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder``.

Example
-------

In the following examples, the code accepts a user name from the user,
which it uses to create a connection string for an SQL database.

The first example concatenates the unvalidated and unencoded user input
directly into the connection string. A malicious user could provide
special characters to change the meaning of the connection string, and
connect to a completely different server.

The second example uses the ``SqlConnectionStringBuilder`` to construct
the connection string and therefore prevents a malicious user modifying
the meaning of the connection string.

.. code:: csharp

    using System.Data.SqlClient;
    using System.Web;

    public class ResourceInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler
    {
        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            string userName = ctx.Request.QueryString["userName"];

            // BAD: Direct use of user input in a connection string passed to SqlConnection
            string connectionString = "server=(local);user id=" + userName + ";password= pass;";
            SqlConnection sqlConnectionBad = new SqlConnection(connectionString);

            // GOOD: Use SqlConnectionStringBuilder to safely include user input in a connection string
            SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder();
            builder["Data Source"] = "(local)";
            builder["integrated Security"] = true;
            builder["user id"] = userName;
            SqlConnection sqlConnectionGood = new SqlConnection(builder.ConnectionString);
        }
    }
