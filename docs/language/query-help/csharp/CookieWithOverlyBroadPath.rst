This rule finds cookies with an overly broad path. Cookies with an
overly broad path, such as the root context path ("/"), can be accessed
by all web applications on the same domain name. A cookie with sensitive
data, but with too broad a path, could hence be read and tampered by a
less secure and untrusted application.

Recommendation
--------------

Precisely define the path of the web application for which this cookie
is valid.

Example
-------

In this example the cookie will be accessible to all applications
regardless of their path. Most likely some of these applications are
less secure than others and do not even need to access the same cookies.

.. code:: csharp

    class CookieWithOverlyBroadPath
    {
        static public void AddCookie()
        {
            HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("sessionID");
            cookie.Path = "/";
        }
    }

In the following example the cookie is only accessible to the web
application at the "/ebanking" path.

.. code:: csharp

    class CookieWithOverlyBroadPathFix
    {
        static public void AddCookie()
        {
            HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("sessionID");
            cookie.Path = "/ebanking";
        }
    }
