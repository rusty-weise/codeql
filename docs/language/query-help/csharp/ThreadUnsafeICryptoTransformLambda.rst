Classes that implement ``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform``
are not thread safe.

This problem is caused by the way these classes are implemented using
Microsoft CAPI/CNG patterns.

For example, when a hash class implements this interface, there would
typically be an instance-specific hash object created (for example using
``BCryptCreateHash`` function). This object can be called multiple times
to add data to the hash (for example ``BCryptHashData``). Finally, a
function is called that finishes the hash and returns the data (for
example ``BCryptFinishHash``).

Allowing the same hash object to be called with data from multiple
threads before calling the finish function could potentially lead to
incorrect results.

For example, if you have multiple threads hashing ``"abc"`` on a static
hash object, you may occasionally obtain the results (incorrectly) for
hashing ``"abcabc"``, or face other unexpected behavior.

It is very unlikely somebody outside Microsoft would write a class that
implements ``ICryptoTransform``, and even if they do, it is likely that
they will follow the same common pattern as the existing classes
implementing this interface.

Any object that implements
``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` should not be used in
concurrent threads as the instance members of such object are also not
thread safe.

Potential problems may not be evident at first, but can range from
explicit errors such as exceptions, to incorrect results when sharing an
instance of such an object in multiple threads.

Recommendation
--------------

Create new instances of the object that implements or has a field of
type ``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` to avoid sharing
it accross multiple threads.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates the dangers of using a shared
``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` in a way that
generates incorrect results or may raise an exception.

.. code:: csharp

    public static void RunThreadUnSafeICryptoTransformLambdaBad()
    {
        const int threadCount = 4;
        // This local variable for a hash object is going to be shared across multiple threads
        var sha1 = SHA1.Create();
        var b = new Barrier(threadCount);
        Action start = () => {
            b.SignalAndWait();
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            {
                var pwd = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
                var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(pwd);
                // This call may fail, or return incorrect results
                sha1.ComputeHash(bytes);
            }
        };
        var threads = Enumerable.Range(0, threadCount)
                                .Select(_ => new ThreadStart(start))
                                .Select(x => new Thread(x))
                                .ToList();
        foreach (var t in threads) t.Start();
        foreach (var t in threads) t.Join();
    }

A simple fix is to change the local variable ``sha1`` being captured by
the lambda to be a local variable within the lambda.

.. code:: csharp

    public static void RunThreadUnSafeICryptoTransformLambdaFixed()
    {
        const int threadCount = 4;
        var b = new Barrier(threadCount);
        Action start = () => {
            b.SignalAndWait();
            // The hash object is no longer shared
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            {
                var sha1 = SHA1.Create();
                var pwd = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
                var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(pwd);
                sha1.ComputeHash(bytes);
            }
        };
        var threads = Enumerable.Range(0, threadCount)
                                .Select(_ => new ThreadStart(start))
                                .Select(x => new Thread(x))
                                .ToList();
        foreach (var t in threads) t.Start();
        foreach (var t in threads) t.Join();
    }
