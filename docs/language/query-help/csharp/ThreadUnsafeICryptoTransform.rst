Classes that implement ``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform``
are not thread safe.

This problem is caused by the way these classes are implemented using
Microsoft CAPI/CNG patterns.

For example, when a hash class implements this interface, there would
typically be an instance-specific hash object created (for example using
``BCryptCreateHash`` function). This object can be called multiple times
to add data to the hash (for example ``BCryptHashData``). Finally, a
function is called that finishes the hash and returns the data (for
example ``BCryptFinishHash``).

Allowing the same hash object to be called with data from multiple
threads before calling the finish function could potentially lead to
incorrect results.

For example, if you have multiple threads hashing ``"abc"`` on a static
hash object, you may occasionally obtain the results (incorrectly) for
hashing ``"abcabc"``, or face other unexpected behavior.

It is very unlikely somebody outside Microsoft would write a class that
implements ``ICryptoTransform``, and even if they do, it is likely that
they will follow the same common pattern as the existing classes
implementing this interface.

Any object that implements
``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` should not be used in
concurrent threads as the instance members of such object are also not
thread safe.

Potential problems may not be evident at first, but can range from
explicit errors such as exceptions, to incorrect results when sharing an
instance of such an object in multiple threads.

Recommendation
--------------

If the object is shared across instances, you should consider changing
the code to use a non-static object of type
``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` instead.

As an alternative, you could also look into using ``ThreadStatic``
attribute, but make sure you read the initialization remarks on the
documentation.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates the dangers of using a static
``System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform`` in a way that
generates incorrect results.

.. code:: csharp

    internal class TokenCacheThreadUnsafeICryptoTransformDemo
    {
        private static SHA256 _sha = SHA256.Create();

        public string ComputeHash(string data)
        {
            byte[] passwordBytes = UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);
            return Convert.ToBase64String(_sha.ComputeHash(passwordBytes));
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int max = 1000;
            Task[] tasks = new Task[max];

            Action<object> action = (object obj) =>
            {
                var unsafeObj = new TokenCacheThreadUnsafeICryptoTransformDemo();
                if (unsafeObj.ComputeHash((string)obj) != "ungWv48Bz+pBQUDeXa4iI7ADYaOWF3qctBD/YfIAFa0=")
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("**** We got incorrect Results!!! ****");
                }
            };

            for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
            {
                // hash calculated on all threads should be the same:
                // ungWv48Bz+pBQUDeXa4iI7ADYaOWF3qctBD/YfIAFa0= (base64)
                // 
                tasks[i] = Task.Factory.StartNew(action, "abc");
            }

            Task.WaitAll(tasks);
        }
    }

A simple fix is to change the ``_sha`` field from being a static member
to an instance one by removing the ``static`` keyword.

.. code:: csharp

    internal class TokenCacheThreadUnsafeICryptoTransformDemoFixed
    {
        // We are replacing the static SHA256 field with an instance one
        //
        //private static SHA256 _sha = SHA256.Create();
        private SHA256 _sha = SHA256.Create();

        public string ComputeHash(string data)
        {
            byte[] passwordBytes = UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);
            return Convert.ToBase64String(_sha.ComputeHash(passwordBytes));
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int max = 1000;
            Task[] tasks = new Task[max];

            Action<object> action = (object obj) =>
            {
                var safeObj = new TokenCacheThreadUnsafeICryptoTransformDemoFixed();
                if (safeObj.ComputeHash((string)obj) != "ungWv48Bz+pBQUDeXa4iI7ADYaOWF3qctBD/YfIAFa0=")
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("**** We got incorrect Results!!! ****");
                }
            };

            for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
            {
                // hash calculated on all threads should be the same:
                // ungWv48Bz+pBQUDeXa4iI7ADYaOWF3qctBD/YfIAFa0= (base64)
                // 
                tasks[i] = Task.Factory.StartNew(action, "abc");
            }

            Task.WaitAll(tasks);
        }
    }
