It is dangerous to use the result of a virtual method call in pointer
arithmetic without validation if external users can provide their own
implementation of the virtual method. For example, if the analyzed
project is distributed as a library or framework, then the end-user
could provide a new implementation that returns any value.

Recommendation
--------------

Always validate the result of virtual methods calls before performing
pointer arithmetic to avoid reading or writing outside the bounds of an
allocated buffer.

Example
-------

In this example, we write to a given element of an array, using an
instance of the ``PossiblyOverridableClass`` to determine which element
to write to.

In the first case, the ``GetElementNumber`` method is called, and the
result is used in pointer arithmetic without any validation. If the user
can define a subtype of ``PossiblyOverridableClass``, they can create an
implementation of ``GetElementNumber`` that returns an invalid element
number. This would lead to a write occurring outside the bounds of the
``charArray``.

In the second case, the result of ``GetElementNumber`` is stored, and
confirmed to be within the bounds of the array. Note that it is not
sufficient to check that it is smaller than the length. We must also
ensure that it's greater than zero, to prevent writes to locations
before the buffer as well as afterwards.

.. code:: csharp

    public class PossiblyOverridable
    {
        public virtual int GetElementNumber()
        {
            // By default returns 0, which is safe
            return 0;
        }
    }

    public class PointerArithmetic
    {
        public unsafe void WriteToOffset(PossiblyOverridable possiblyOverridable,
                                         char[] charArray)
        {
            fixed (char* charPointer = charArray)
            {
                // BAD: Unvalidated use of virtual method call result in pointer arithmetic
                char* newCharPointer = charPointer + possiblyOverridable.GetElementNumber();
                *newCharPointer = 'A';
                // GOOD: Check that the number is viable
                int number = possiblyOverridable.GetElementNumber();
                if (number >= 0 && number < charArray.Length)
                {
                    char* newCharPointer2 = charPointer + number;
                    *newCharPointer = 'A';
                }
            }
        }
    }
