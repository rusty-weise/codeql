This rule finds cookies that are made to expire in more than 5 minutes
from now. Cookies are usually non-persistent, in which case they reside
in the browser's memory only. However, by setting an expiration date in
the future, cookies can be made persistent and are then written to disk
to survive the browser restarts. If a persistent cookie is set to expire
in a fairly distant future, it is easier for an attacker to steal its
data.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not put sensitive information in persistent cookies.
