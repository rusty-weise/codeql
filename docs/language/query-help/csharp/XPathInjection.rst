If an XPath expression is built using string concatenation, and the
components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to
be able to create a malicious XPath expression.

Recommendation
--------------

If user input must be included in an XPath expression, pre-compile the
query and use variable references to include the user input.

When using the ``System.Xml.XPath`` API, this can be done by creating a
custom subtype of ``System.Xml.Xsl.XsltContext``, and implementing
``ResolveVariable(String,?String)`` to return the user provided data.
This custom context can be specified for a given ``XPathExpression``
using ``XPathExpression.SetContext()``. For more details, see the "User
Defined Functions and Variables" webpage in the list of references.

Example
-------

In the first example, the code accepts a user name specified by the
user, and uses this unvalidated and unsanitized value in an XPath
expression. This is vulnerable to the user providing special characters
or string sequences that change the meaning of the XPath expression to
search for different values.

In the second example, the XPath expression is a hard-coded string that
specifies some variables, which are safely replaced at runtime using a
custom ``XsltContext`` that looks up the variables in an
``XsltArgumentList``.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Xml.XPath;

    public class XPathInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler
    {
        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            string userName = ctx.Request.QueryString["userName"];

            // BAD: Use user-provided data directly in an XPath expression
            string badXPathExpr = "//users/user[login/text()='" + userName + "']/home_dir/text()";
            XPathExpression.Compile(badXPathExpr);

            // GOOD: XPath expression uses variables to refer to parameters
            string xpathExpression = "//users/user[login/text()=$username]/home_dir/text()";
            XPathExpression xpath = XPathExpression.Compile(xpathExpression);

            // Arguments are provided as a XsltArgumentList()
            XsltArgumentList varList = new XsltArgumentList();
            varList.AddParam("userName", string.Empty, userName);

            // CustomContext is an application specific class, that looks up variables in the
            // expression from the varList.
            CustomContext context = new CustomContext(new NameTable(), varList)
          xpath.SetContext(context);
        }
    }
