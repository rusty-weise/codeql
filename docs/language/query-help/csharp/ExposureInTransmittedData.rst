Transmitting sensitive data to the user is a potential security risk.
Always ensure that transmitted data is intended for the user. For
example, passwords and the contents of database exceptions are generally
not appropriate to send to the user, as they reveal information that
could be abused or exploited.

Recommendation
--------------

Avoid transmitting passwords or exceptions to the user. Instead, create
a more user-friendly message that does not contain potentially sensitive
information. Technical errors should be written to a log file.

Example
-------

The following example shows the user password being sent back to the
user.

.. code:: csharp

    public class Handler : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            try
            {
           ...
        }
            catch (AuthenticationFailure ex)
            {
                ctx.Response.Write("Invalid password: " + password);
            }
        }
    }

The following example shows a database exception being sent to the user.
Exceptions can often contain unnecessary technical or sensitive
information that should not be seen by the user.

.. code:: csharp

    public class Handler : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            try
            {
           ...
        }
            catch (DbException ex)
            {
                ctx.Response.Write("Database error: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
