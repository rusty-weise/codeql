Constructing a regular expression with unsanitized user input is
dangerous as a malicious user may be able to modify the meaning of the
expression. In particular, such a user may be able to provide a regular
expression fragment that takes exponential time in the worst case, and
use that to perform a Denial of Service attack.

Recommendation
--------------

For user input that is intended to be referenced as a string literal in
a regular expression, use the ``Regex.Escape`` method to escape any
special characters. If the regular expression is intended to be
configurable by the user, then a timeout should be used to avoid Denial
of Service attacks. For C# applications, a timeout can be provided to
the ``Regex`` constructor. Alternatively, apply a global timeout by
setting the ``REGEX_DEFAULT_MATCH_TIMEOUT`` application domain property,
using the ``AppDomain.SetData`` method.

Example
-------

The following example shows a HTTP request parameter that is used as a
regular expression, and matched against another request parameter.

In the first case, the regular expression is used without a timeout, and
the user-provided regex is not escaped. If a malicious user provides a
regex that has exponential worst case performance, then this could lead
to a Denial of Service.

In the second case, the user input is escaped using ``Regex.Escape``
before being included in the regular expression. This ensures that the
user cannot insert characters which have a special meaning in regular
expressions.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

    public class RegexInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            string name = ctx.Request.QueryString["name"];
            string userInput = ctx.Request.QueryString["userInput"];

            // BAD: Unsanitized user input is used to construct a regular expression
            new Regex("^" + name + "=.*$").Match(userInput);

            // GOOD: User input is sanitized before constructing the regex
            string safeName = Regex.Escape(name);
            new Regex("^" + safeName + "=.*$").Match(userInput);
        }
    }
