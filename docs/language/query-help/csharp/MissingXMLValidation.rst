If unsanitized user input is processed as XML, it should be validated
against a known schema. If no validation occurs, or if the validation
relies on the schema or DTD specified in the document itself, then the
XML document may contain any data in any form, which may invalidate
assumptions the program later makes.

Recommendation
--------------

All XML provided by a user should be validated against a known schema
when it is processed.

If using ``XmlReader.Create``, you should always pass an instance of
``XmlReaderSettings``, with the following properties:

-  ``ValidationType`` must be set to ``Schema``. If this property is
   unset, no validation occurs. If it is set to ``DTD``, the document is
   only validated against the DTD specified in the user-provided
   document itself - which could be specified as anything by a malicious
   user.
-  ``ValidationFlags`` must not include ``ProcessInlineSchema`` or
   ``ProcessSchemaLocation``. These flags allow a user to provide their
   own inline schema or schema location for validation, allowing a
   malicious user to bypass the known schema validation.

Example
-------

In the following example, text provided by a user is loaded using
``XmlReader.Create``. In the first three examples, insufficient
validation occurs, because either no validation is specified, or
validation is only specified against a DTD provided by the user, or the
validation permits a user to provide an inline schema. In the final
example, a known schema is provided, and validation is set, using an
instance of ``XmlReaderSettings``. This ensures that the user input is
properly validated against the known schema.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Xml;
    using System.Xml.Schema;

    public class MissingXmlValidationHandler : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            String userProvidedXml = ctx.Request.QueryString["userProvidedXml"];

            // BAD: User provided XML is processed without any validation,
            //      because there is no settings instance configured.
            XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(userProvidedXml));

            // BAD: User provided XML is processed without any validation,
            //      because the settings instance specifies DTD as the ValidationType
            XmlReaderSettings badSettings = new XmlReaderSettings();
            badSettings.ValidationType = ValidationType.DTD;
            XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(userProvidedXml), badSettings);

            // BAD: User provided XML is processed with validation, but the ProcessInlineSchema
            //      option is specified, so an attacker can provide their own schema to validate
            //      against.
            XmlReaderSettings badInlineSettings = new XmlReaderSettings();
            badInlineSettings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;
            badInlineSettings.ValidationFlags |= XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessInlineSchema;
            XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(userProvidedXml), badInlineSettings);

            // GOOD: User provided XML is processed with validation
            XmlReaderSettings goodSettings = new XmlReaderSettings();
            goodSettings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;
            goodSettings.Schemas = new XmlSchemaSet() { { "urn:my-schema", "my.xsd" } };
            XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(userProvidedXml), goodSettings);
        }
    }
