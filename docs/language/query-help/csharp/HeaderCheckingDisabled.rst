This rule finds places in the code where header checking is disabled.
When header checking is enabled, which is the default, the ``\r`` or
``\n`` characters found in a response header are encoded to ``%0d`` and
``%0a``. This defeats header-injection attacks by making the injected
material part of the same header line. If you disable header checking,
you open potential attack vectors against your client code.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not disable header checking.
