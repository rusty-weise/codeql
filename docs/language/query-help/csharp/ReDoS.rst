Matching user input against a regular expression which takes exponential
time in the worst case can allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of
Service ("DoS") attack by crafting input that takes a long time to
execute.

Most regular expression engines, including the C# standard library
implementation, are designed to work with an extended regular expression
syntax. Although this provides flexibility for the user, it can prevent
the engine from constructing an efficient implementation of the matcher
in all circumstances. In particular, the "worst case time complexity"
(see the references) of certain regular expressions may be
"exponential". This would allow a malicious user to provide some input
which causes the regular expression to take a very long time to execute.

Typically, a regular expression is vulnerable to this attack if it
applies repetition to a sub-expression which itself is repeated, or
contains overlapping options. For example, ``(a+)+`` is vulnerable to a
string such as ``aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab``. More information about
the precise circumstances can be found in the references.

Recommendation
--------------

Modify the regular expression to avoid the exponential worst case time.
If this is not possible, then a timeout should be used to avoid a denial
of service. For C# applications, a timeout can be provided to the
``Regex`` constructor. Alternatively, apply a global timeout by setting
the ``REGEX_DEFAULT_MATCH_TIMEOUT`` application domain property, using
the ``AppDomain.SetData`` method.

Example
-------

The following example shows a HTTP request parameter that is matched
against a regular expression which has exponential worst case
performance. In the first case, it is matched without a timeout, which
can lead to a denial of service. In the second case, a timeout is used
to cancel the evaluation of the regular expression after 1 second.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

    public class ReDoSHandler : IHttpHandler
    {

        public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)
        {
            string userInput = ctx.Request.QueryString["userInput"];

            // BAD: User input is matched against a regex with exponential worst case behavior
            new Regex("^([a-z]*)*$").Match(userInput);

            // GOOD: Regex is given a timeout to avoid DoS
            new Regex("^([a-z]*)*$",
                      RegexOptions.IgnoreCase,
                      TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)).Match(userInput);
        }
    }
