C# supports runtime loading of assemblies by path through the use of the
``System.Reflection.Assembly`` API. If an external user can influence
the path used to load an assembly, then the application can potentially
be tricked into loading an assembly which was not intended to be loaded,
and executing arbitrary code.

Recommendation
--------------

Avoid loading assemblies based on user provided input. If this is not
possible, ensure that the path is validated before being used with
``Assembly``. For example, compare the provided input against a
whitelist of known safe assemblies, or confirm that the path is
restricted to a single directory which only contains safe assemblies.

Example
-------

In this example, user input is provided describing the path to an
assembly, which is loaded without validation. This is problematic
because it allows the user to load any assembly installed on the system,
and is particularly problematic if an attacker can upload a custom DLL
elsewhere on the system.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Reflection;

    public class AssemblyPathInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler {
      public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx) {
        string assemblyPath = ctx.Request.QueryString["assemblyPath"];

        // BAD: Load assembly based on user input
        var badAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(assemblyPath);

        // Method called on loaded assembly. If the user can control the loaded assembly, then this
        // could result in a remote code execution vulnerability
        MethodInfo m = badAssembly.GetType("Config").GetMethod("GetCustomPath");
        Object customPath = m.Invoke(null, null);
        // ...
      }
    }

In the corrected version, user input is validated against one of two
options, and the assembly is only loaded if the user input matches one
of those options.

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Reflection;

    public class AssemblyPathInjectionHandler : IHttpHandler {
      public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx) {
        string configType = ctx.Request.QueryString["configType"];

        if (configType.equals("configType1") || configType.equals("configType2")) {
          // GOOD: Loaded assembly is one of the two known safe options
          var safeAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(@"C:\SafeLibraries\" + configType + ".dll");

          // Code execution is limited to one of two known and vetted assemblies
          MethodInfo m = safeAssembly.GetType("Config").GetMethod("GetCustomPath");
          Object customPath = m.Invoke(null, null);
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
