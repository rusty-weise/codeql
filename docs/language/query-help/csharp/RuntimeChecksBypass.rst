Fields that are deserialized should be validated, otherwise the
deserialized object could contain invalid data.

This query finds cases where a field is validated in a constructor, but
not in a deserialization method. This is an indication that the
deserialization method is missing a validation step.

Recommendation
--------------

If a field needs to be validated, then ensure that validation is also
performed during deserialization.

Example
-------

The following example has the validation of the ``Age`` field in the
constructor but not in the deserialization method:

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;

    [Serializable]
    public class PersonBad : ISerializable
    {
        public int Age;

        public PersonBad(int age)
        {
            if (age < 0)
                throw new ArgumentException(nameof(age));
            Age = age;
        }

        [OnDeserializing]
        void ISerializable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
        {
            Age = info.GetInt32("age");  // BAD - write is unsafe
        }
    }

The problem is fixed by adding validation to the deserialization method
as follows:

.. code:: csharp

    using System;
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;

    [Serializable]
    public class PersonGood : ISerializable
    {
        public int Age;

        public PersonGood(int age)
        {
            if (age < 0)
                throw new ArgumentException(nameof(age));
            Age = age;
        }

        [OnDeserializing]
        void ISerializable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
        {
            int age = info.GetInt32("age");
            if (age < 0)
                throw new SerializationException(nameof(Age));
            Age = age;  // GOOD - write is safe
        }
    }
