Accessing files using paths constructed from user-controlled data can
allow an attacker to access unexpected resources. This can result in
sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being
able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.

Recommendation
--------------

Validate user input before using it to construct a file path, either
using an off-the-shelf library function like
``werkzeug.utils.secure_filename``, or by performing custom validation.

Ideally, follow these rules:

-  Do not allow more than a single "." character.
-  Do not allow directory separators such as "/" or "" (depending on the
   file system).
-  Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as "../".
   For example, after applying this filter to ".../...//", the resulting
   string would still be "../".
-  Use an allowlist of known good patterns.

Example
-------

In the first example, a file name is read from an HTTP request and then
used to access a file. However, a malicious user could enter a file name
that is an absolute path, such as ``"/etc/passwd"``.

In the second example, it appears that the user is restricted to opening
a file within the ``"user"`` home directory. However, a malicious user
could enter a file name containing special characters. For example, the
string ``"../../../etc/passwd"`` will result in the code reading the
file located at ``"/server/static/images/../../../etc/passwd"``, which
is the system's password file. This file would then be sent back to the
user, giving them access to all the system's passwords.

In the third example, the path used to access the file system is
normalized *before* being checked against a known prefix. This ensures
that regardless of the user input, the resulting path is safe.

.. code:: python

    import os.path


    urlpatterns = [
        # Route to user_picture
        url(r'^user-pic1$', user_picture1, name='user-picture1'),
        url(r'^user-pic2$', user_picture2, name='user-picture2'),
        url(r'^user-pic3$', user_picture3, name='user-picture3')
    ]


    def user_picture1(request):
        """A view that is vulnerable to malicious file access."""
        filename = request.GET.get('p')
        # BAD: This could read any file on the file system
        data = open(filename, 'rb').read()
        return HttpResponse(data)

    def user_picture2(request):
        """A view that is vulnerable to malicious file access."""
        base_path = '/server/static/images'
        filename = request.GET.get('p')
        # BAD: This could still read any file on the file system
        data = open(os.path.join(base_path, filename), 'rb').read()
        return HttpResponse(data)

    def user_picture3(request):
        """A view that is not vulnerable to malicious file access."""
        base_path = '/server/static/images'
        filename = request.GET.get('p')
        #GOOD -- Verify with normalised version of path
        fullpath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(base_path, filename))
        if not fullpath.startswith(base_path):
            raise SecurityException()
        data = open(fullpath, 'rb').read()
        return HttpResponse(data)
