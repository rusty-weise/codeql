Directly evaluating user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter)
as code without properly sanitizing the input first allows an attacker
arbitrary code execution. This can occur when user input is passed to
code that interprets it as an expression to be evaluated, such as
``eval`` or ``exec``.

Recommendation
--------------

Avoid including user input in any expression that may be dynamically
evaluated. If user input must be included, use context-specific escaping
before including it. It is important that the correct escaping is used
for the type of evaluation that will occur.

Example
-------

The following example shows two functions setting a name from a request.
The first function uses ``exec`` to execute the ``setname`` function.
This is dangerous as it can allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary
code on the server. For example, the user could supply the value
``"' + subprocess.call('rm -rf') + '"`` to destroy the server's file
system. The second function calls the ``setname`` function directly and
is thus safe.

.. code:: python


    urlpatterns = [
        # Route to code_execution
        url(r'^code-ex1$', code_execution_bad, name='code-execution-bad'),
        url(r'^code-ex2$', code_execution_good, name='code-execution-good')
    ]

    def code_execution(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            first_name = base64.decodestring(request.POST.get('first_name', ''))
            #BAD -- Allow user to define code to be run.
            exec("setname('%s')" % first_name)

    def code_execution(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            first_name = base64.decodestring(request.POST.get('first_name', ''))
            #GOOD --Call code directly
            setname(first_name)
