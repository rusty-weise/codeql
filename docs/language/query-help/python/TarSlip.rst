Extracting files from a malicious tar archive without validating that
the destination file path is within the destination directory can cause
files outside the destination directory to be overwritten, due to the
possible presence of directory traversal elements (``..``) in archive
paths.

Tar archives contain archive entries representing each file in the
archive. These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file
paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements
such as the directory traversal element (``..``). If these file paths
are used to determine an output file to write the contents of the
archive item to, then the file may be written to an unexpected location.
This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or
an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected
files.

For example, if a tar archive contains a file entry ``..\sneaky-file``,
and the tar archive is extracted to the directory ``c:\output``, then
naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of
``c:\output\..\sneaky-file``, which would cause the file to be written
to ``c:\sneaky-file``.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that output paths constructed from tar archive entries are
validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.

The recommended way of writing an output file from a tar archive entry
is to check that ``".."`` does not occur in the path.

Example
-------

In this example an archive is extracted without validating file paths.
If ``archive.tar`` contained relative paths (for instance, if it were
created by something like ``tar -cf archive.tar ../file.txt``) then
executing this code could write to locations outside the destination
directory.

.. code:: python


    import tarfile

    with tarfile.open('archive.zip') as tar:
        #BAD : This could write any file on the filesystem.
        for entry in tar:
            tar.extract(entry, "/tmp/unpack/")

To fix this vulnerability, we need to check that the path does not
contain any ``".."`` elements in it.

.. code:: python


    import tarfile
    import os.path

    with tarfile.open('archive.zip') as tar:
        for entry in tar:
            #GOOD: Check that entry is safe
            if os.path.isabs(entry.name) or ".." in entry.name:
                raise ValueError("Illegal tar archive entry")
            tar.extract(entry, "/tmp/unpack/")
