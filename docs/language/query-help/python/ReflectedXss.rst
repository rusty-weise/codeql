Directly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to
a webpage without properly sanitizing the input first, allows for a
cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Recommendation
--------------

To guard against cross-site scripting, consider escaping the input
before writing user input to the page. The standard library provides
escaping functions: ``html.escape()`` for Python 3.2 upwards or
``cgi.escape()`` older versions of Python. Most frameworks also provide
their own escaping functions, for example ``flask.escape()``.

Example
-------

The following example is a minimal flask app which shows a safe and
unsafe way to render the given name back to the page. The first view is
unsafe as ``first_name`` is not escaped, leaving the page vulnerable to
cross-site scripting attacks. The second view is safe as ``first_name``
is escaped, so it is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask, request, make_response, escape

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/unsafe')
    def unsafe():
        first_name = request.args.get('name', '')
        return make_response("Your name is " + first_name)

    @app.route('/safe')
    def safe():
        first_name = request.args.get('name', '')
        return make_response("Your name is " + escape(first_name))
