When creating a file, POSIX systems allow permissions to be specified
for owner, group and others separately. Permissions should be kept as
strict as possible, preventing access to the files contents by other
users.

Recommendation
--------------

Restrict the file permissions of files to prevent any but the owner
being able to read or write to that file
