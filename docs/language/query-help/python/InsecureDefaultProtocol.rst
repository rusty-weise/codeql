The ``ssl`` library defaults to an insecure version of SSL/TLS when no
specific protocol version is specified. This may leave the connection
vulnerable to attack.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that a modern, strong protocol is used. All versions of SSL, and
TLS 1.0 are known to be vulnerable to attacks. Using TLS 1.1 or above is
strongly recommended. If no explicit ``ssl_version`` is specified, the
default ``PROTOCOL_TLS`` is chosen. This protocol is insecure and should
not be used.

Example
-------

The following code shows two different ways of setting up a connection
using SSL or TLS. They are both potentially insecure because the default
version is used.

.. code:: python

    import ssl
    import socket

    # Using the deprecated ssl.wrap_socket method
    ssl.wrap_socket(socket.socket())

    # Using SSLContext
    context = ssl.SSLContext()

Both of the cases above should be updated to use a secure protocol
instead, for instance by specifying ``ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1`` as
a keyword argument.

Note that ``ssl.wrap_socket`` has been deprecated in Python 3.7. A
preferred alternative is to use ``ssl.SSLContext``, which is supported
in Python 2.7.9 and 3.2 and later versions.
