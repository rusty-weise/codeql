This rule finds ``delete`` expressions whose argument is a pointer that
points to memory allocated using the ``malloc`` function, and calls to
``free`` whose argument is a pointer that points to memory allocated
using the ``new`` operator. Behavior in such cases is undefined and
should be avoided.

Recommendation
--------------

Use the ``delete`` operator when freeing memory allocated with ``new``,
and the ``free`` function when freeing memory allocated with ``malloc``.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    Record *ptr = new Record(...);

    ...

    free(ptr); // BAD: ptr was created using 'new', but is being freed using 'free'
