When checking for integer overflow, you may often write tests like
``p + i < p``. This works fine if ``p`` and ``i`` are unsigned integers,
since any overflow in the addition will cause the value to simply "wrap
around." However, using this pattern when ``p`` is a pointer is
problematic because pointer overflow has undefined behavior according to
the C and C++ standards. If the addition overflows and has an undefined
result, the comparison will likewise be undefined; it may produce an
unintended result, or may be deleted entirely by an optimizing compiler.

Recommendation
--------------

To check whether an index ``i`` is less than the length of an array,
simply compare these two numbers as unsigned integers:
``i < ARRAY_LENGTH``. If the length of the array is defined as the
difference between two pointers ``ptr`` and ``p_end``, write
``i < p_end - ptr``. If ``i`` is signed, cast it to unsigned in order to
guard against negative ``i``. For example, write
``(size_t)i < p_end - ptr``.

Example
-------

An invalid check for pointer overflow is most often seen as part of
checking whether a number ``a`` is too large by checking first if adding
the number to ``ptr`` goes past the end of an allocation and then
checking if adding it to ``ptr`` creates a pointer so large that it
overflows and wraps around.

.. code:: cpp

    bool not_in_range(T *ptr, T *ptr_end, size_t i) {
        return ptr + i >= ptr_end || ptr + i < ptr; // BAD
    }

In both of these checks, the operations are performed in the wrong
order. First, an expression that may cause undefined behavior is
evaluated (``ptr + i``), and then the result is checked for being in
range. But once undefined behavior has happened in the pointer addition,
it cannot be recovered from: it's too late to perform the range check
after a possible pointer overflow.

While it's not the subject of this query, the expression
``ptr + i < ptr_end`` is also an invalid range check. It's undefined
behavor in C/C++ to create a pointer that points more than one past the
end of an allocation.

The next example shows how to portably check whether an unsigned number
is outside the range of an allocation between ``ptr`` and ``ptr_end``.

.. code:: cpp

    bool not_in_range(T *ptr, T *ptr_end, size_t i) {
        return i >= ptr_end - ptr; // GOOD
    }
