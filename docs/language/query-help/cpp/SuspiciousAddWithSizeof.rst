Pointer arithmetic in C and C++ is automatically scaled according to the
size of the data type. For example, if the type of ``p`` is ``T*`` and
``sizeof(T) == 4`` then the expression ``p+1`` adds 4 bytes to ``p``.

This query finds code of the form ``p + k*sizeof(T)``. Such code is
usually a mistake because there is no need to manually scale the offset
by ``sizeof(T)``.

Recommendation
--------------

1. Whenever possible, use the array subscript operator rather than
   pointer arithmetic. For example, replace ``*(p+k)`` with ``p[k]``.
2. Cast to the correct type before using pointer arithmetic. For
   example, if the type of ``p`` is ``char*`` but it really points to an
   array of type ``double[]`` then use the syntax ``(double*)p + k`` to
   get a pointer to the ``k``'th element of the array.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    int example1(int i) {
      int intArray[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
      int *intPointer = intArray;
      // BAD: the offset is already automatically scaled by sizeof(int),
      // so this code will compute the wrong offset.
      return *(intPointer + (i * sizeof(int)));
    }

    int example2(int i) {
      int intArray[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
      int *intPointer = intArray;
      // GOOD: the offset is automatically scaled by sizeof(int).
      return *(intPointer + i);
    }
