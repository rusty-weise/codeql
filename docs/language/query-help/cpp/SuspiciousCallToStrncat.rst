The standard library function ``strncat`` appends a source string to a
target string. The third argument defines the maximum number of
characters to append and should be less than or equal to the remaining
space in the destination buffer. Calls of the form
``strncat(dest, src, strlen(dest))`` or
``strncat(dest, src, sizeof(dest))`` set the third argument to the
entire size of the destination buffer. Executing a call of this type may
cause a buffer overflow unless the buffer is known to be empty. Buffer
overflows can lead to anything from a segmentation fault to a security
vulnerability.

Recommendation
--------------

Check the highlighted function calls carefully to ensure that no buffer
overflow is possible. For a more robust solution, consider updating the
function call to include the remaining space in the destination buffer.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    strncat(dest, src, strlen(dest)); //wrong: should use remaining size of dest

    strncat(dest, src, sizeof(dest)); //wrong: should use remaining size of dest. 
                                      //Also fails if dest is a pointer and not an array.
