The program uses input from the user as a format string for ``printf``
style functions. This can lead to buffer overflows or data
representation problems. An attacker can exploit this weakness to crash
the program, disclose information or even execute arbitrary code.

The results of this rule do not include inputs from the user that are
transferred through global variables. Those can be found in the related
rule "Uncontrolled format string (through global variable)".

Recommendation
--------------

Use constant expressions as the format strings. If you need to print a
value from the user, use ``printf("%s", value_from_user)``.

Example
-------

.. code:: c

    #include <stdio.h>

    void printWrapper(char *str) {
        printf(str);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        // This should be avoided
        printf(argv[1]);

        // This should be avoided too, because it has the same effect
        printWrapper(argv[1]);

        // This is fine
        printf("%s", argv[1]);
    }
