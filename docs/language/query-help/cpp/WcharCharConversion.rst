`Click to see the query in the CodeQL
repository <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-704/WcharCharConversion.ql>`__

This rule indicates a potentially incorrect cast from an byte string
(``char *``) to a wide-character string (``wchar_t *``).

This cast might yield strings that are not correctly terminated;
including potential buffer overruns when using such strings with some
dangerous APIs.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not explicitly cast byte strings to wide-character strings.

For string literals, prepend the literal string with the letter "L" to
indicate that the string is a wide-character string (``wchar_t *``).

For converting a byte literal to a wide-character string literal, you
would need to use the appropriate conversion function for the platform
you are using. Please see the references section for options according
to your platform.

Example
-------

In the following example, an byte string literal (``"a"``) is cast to a
wide-character string.

.. code:: cpp

    wchar_t* pSrc;

    pSrc = (wchar_t*)"a"; // casting a byte-string literal "a" to a wide-character string

To fix this issue, prepend the literal with the letter "L" (``L"a"``) to
define it as a wide-character string.
