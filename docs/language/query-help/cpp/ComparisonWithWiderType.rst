In a loop condition, comparison of a value of a narrow type with a value
of a wide type may result in unexpected behavior if the wider value is
sufficiently large (or small). This is because the narrower value may
overflow. This can lead to an infinite loop.

Recommendation
--------------

Change the types of the compared values so that the value on the
narrower side of the comparison is at least as wide as the value it is
being compared with.

Example
-------

In this example, ``bytes_received`` is compared against ``max_get`` in a
``while`` loop. However, ``bytes_received`` is an ``int16_t``, and
``max_get`` is an ``int32_t``. Because ``max_get`` is larger than
``INT16_MAX``, the loop condition is always ``true``, so the loop never
terminates.

This problem is avoided in the 'GOOD' case because ``bytes_received2``
is an ``int32_t``, which is as wide as the type of ``max_get``.

.. code:: c

    void main(int argc, char **argv) {
        uint32_t big_num = INT32_MAX;
        char buf[big_num];
        int16_t bytes_received = 0;
        int max_get = INT16_MAX + 1;

        // BAD: 'bytes_received' is compared with a value of a wider type.
        // 'bytes_received' overflows before  reaching 'max_get',
        // causing an infinite loop
        while (bytes_received < max_get)
            bytes_received += get_from_input(buf, bytes_received);
        }

        uint32_t bytes_received = 0;

        // GOOD: 'bytes_received2' has a type  at least as wide as 'max_get'
        while (bytes_received < max_get) {
            bytes_received += get_from_input(buf, bytes_received);
        }

    }


    int getFromInput(char *buf, short pos) {
        // write to buf
        // ...
        return 1;
    }
