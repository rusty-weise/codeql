The program contains an and-expression where the array access is defined
before the range check. Consequently the array is accessed without any
bounds checking. The range check does not protect the program from
segmentation faults caused by attempts to read beyond the end of a
buffer.

Recommendation
--------------

Update the and-expression so that the range check precedes the array
offset. This will ensure that the bounds are checked before the array is
accessed.

Example
-------

The ``find`` function can read past the end of the buffer pointed to by
``str`` if ``start`` is longer than or equal to the length of the buffer
(or longer than ``len``, depending on the contents of the buffer).

.. code:: c

    int find(int start, char *str, char goal)
    {
        int len = strlen(str);
        //Potential buffer overflow
        for (int i = start; str[i] != 0 && i < len; i++) { 
            if (str[i] == goal)
                return i; 
        }
        return -1;
    }

    int findRangeCheck(int start, char *str, char goal)
    {
        int len = strlen(str);
        //Range check protects against buffer overflow
        for (int i = start; i < len && str[i] != 0 ; i++) {
            if (str[i] == goal)
                return i; 
        }
        return -1;
    }



Update the and-expression so that the range check precedes the array
offset (for example, the ``findRangeCheck`` function).
