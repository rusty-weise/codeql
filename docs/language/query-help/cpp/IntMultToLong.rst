This rule finds code that converts the result of an integer
multiplication to a larger type. Since the conversion applies *after*
the multiplication, arithmetic overflow may still occur.

The rule flags every multiplication of two non-constant integer
expressions that is (explicitly or implicitly) converted to a larger
integer type. The conversion is an indication that the expression would
produce a result that would be too large to fit in the smaller integer
type.

Recommendation
--------------

Use a cast to ensure that the multiplication is done using the larger
integer type to avoid overflow.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    int i = 2000000000;
    long j = i * i; //Wrong: due to overflow on the multiplication between ints, 
                    //will result to j being -1651507200, not 4000000000000000000

    long k = (long) i * i; //Correct: the multiplication is done on longs instead of ints, 
                           //and will not overflow
