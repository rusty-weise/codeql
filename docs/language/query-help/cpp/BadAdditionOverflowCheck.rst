Checking for overflow of integer addition needs to be done with care,
because automatic type promotion can prevent the check from working as
intended, with the same value (``true`` or ``false``) always being
returned.

Recommendation
--------------

Use an explicit cast to make sure that the result of the addition is not
implicitly converted to a larger type.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    bool checkOverflow(unsigned short x, unsigned short y) {
      // BAD: comparison is always false due to type promotion
      return (x + y < x);  
    }

On a typical architecture where ``short`` is 16 bits and ``int`` is 32
bits, the operands of the addition are automatically promoted to
``int``, so it cannot overflow and the result of the comparison is
always false.

The code below implements the check correctly, by using an explicit cast
to make sure that the result of the addition is ``unsigned short``
(which may overflow, in which case the comparison would evaluate to
``true``).

.. code:: cpp

    bool checkOverflow(unsigned short x, unsigned short y) {
      return ((unsigned short)(x + y) < x);  // GOOD: explicit cast
    }
