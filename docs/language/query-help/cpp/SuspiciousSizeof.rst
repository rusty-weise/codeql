This rule finds expressions that take the size of a function parameter
of array type. In C, function parameters of array type are treated as if
they had the corresponding pointer type, so their size is always the
size of the pointer type (typically either four or eight). In
particular, one cannot determine the size of a memory buffer passed as a
parameter in this way. Using the ``sizeof`` operator on pointer types
will produce unexpected results if the developer intended to get the
size of an array instead of the pointer.

Recommendation
--------------

Modify the function to take an extra argument indicating the buffer
size.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    void f(char s[]) {
        int size = sizeof(s); //wrong: s is now a char*, not an array. 
                              //sizeof(s) will evaluate to sizeof(char *)
    }
