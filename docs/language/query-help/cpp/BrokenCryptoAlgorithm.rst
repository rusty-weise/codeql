Using broken or weak cryptographic algorithms can leave data vulnerable
to being decrypted.

Many cryptographic algorithms provided by cryptography libraries are
known to be weak, or flawed. Using such an algorithm means that an
attacker may be able to easily decrypt the encrypted data.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that you use a strong, modern cryptographic algorithm. Use at
least AES-128 or RSA-2048.

Example
-------

The following code shows an example of using the ``advapi`` windows API
to decrypt some data. When creating a key, you must specify which
algorithm to use. The first example uses DES which is an older algorithm
that is now considered weak. The second example uses AES, which is a
strong modern algorithm.

.. code:: c

    void advapi() {
      HCRYPTPROV hCryptProv;
      HCRYPTKEY hKey;
      HCRYPTHASH hHash;
      // other preparation goes here

      // BAD: use 3DES for key
      CryptDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_3DES, hHash, 0, &hKey);

      // GOOD: use AES
      CryptDeriveKey(hCryptProv, CALG_AES_256, hHash, 0, &hKey);
    }
