The return value of a call to ``snprintf`` is the number of characters
that *would have* been written to the buffer assuming there was
sufficient space. In the event that the operation reaches the end of the
buffer and more than one character is discarded, the return value will
be greater than the buffer size. This can cause incorrect behaviour, for
example:

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    #define BUF_SIZE (32)

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        char buffer[BUF_SIZE];
        size_t pos = 0;
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
        {
            pos += snprintf(buffer + pos, BUF_SIZE - pos, "%s", argv[i]);
                // BUF_SIZE - pos may overflow
        }
    }

Recommendation
--------------

The return value of ``snprintf`` should always be checked if it is used,
and values larger than the buffer size should be accounted for.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    #define BUF_SIZE (32)

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        char buffer[BUF_SIZE];
        size_t pos = 0;
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
        {
            int n = snprintf(buffer + pos, BUF_SIZE - pos, "%s", argv[i]);
            if (n < 0 || n >= BUF_SIZE - pos)
            {
                break;
            }
            pos += n;
        }
    }
