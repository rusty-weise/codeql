This code calculates an allocation size by multiplying a user input by a
``sizeof`` expression. Since the user input has no apparent guard on its
magnitude, this multiplication can overflow. When an integer multiply
overflows in C, the result can wrap around and be much smaller than
intended. A later attempt to put data into the allocated buffer can then
overflow.

Recommendation
--------------

Guard all integer parameters that come from an external user. Implement
a guard with the expected range for the parameter and make sure that the
input value meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for this
range. If the input value fails this guard then reject the request
before proceeding further. If the input value passes the guard then
subsequent calculations should not overflow.

Example
-------

.. code:: c

    int factor = atoi(getenv("BRANCHING_FACTOR"));

    // GOOD: Prevent overflow by checking the input
    if (factor < 0 || factor > 1000) {
        log("Factor out of range (%d)\n", factor);
        return -1;
    }

    // This line can allocate too little memory if factor
    // is very large.
    char **root_node = (char **) malloc(factor * sizeof(char *));

This code shows one way to guard that an input value is within the
expected range. If ``factor`` fails the guard, then an error is
returned, and the value is not used as an argument to the subsequent
call to ``malloc``. Without this guard, the allocated buffer might be
too small to hold the data intended for it.
