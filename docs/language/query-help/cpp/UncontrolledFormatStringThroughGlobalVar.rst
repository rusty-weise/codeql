The program uses input from the user, propagated via a global variable,
as a format string for ``printf`` style functions. This can lead to
buffer overflows or data representation problems. An attacker can
exploit this weakness to crash the program, disclose information or even
execute arbitrary code.

This rule only identifies inputs from the user that are transferred
through global variables before being used in ``printf`` style
functions. Analyzing the flow of data through global variables is more
prone to errors and so this rule may identify some examples of code
where the input is not really from the user. For example, when a global
variable is set in two places, one that comes from the user and one that
does not. In this case we would mark all usages of the global variable
as input from the user, but the input from the user may always came
after the call to the ``printf`` style functions.

The results of this rule should be considered alongside the related rule
"Uncontrolled format string" which tracks the flow of the values input
by a user, excluding global variables, until the values are used as the
format argument for a ``printf`` like function call.

Recommendation
--------------

Use constant expressions as the format strings. If you need to print a
value from the user, use ``printf("%s", value_from_user)``.

Example
-------

.. code:: c

    #include <stdio.h>

    char *copy;

    void copyArgv(char **argv) {
        copy = argv[1];
    }

    void printWrapper(char *str) {
        printf(str);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        copyArgv(argv);

        // This should be avoided
        printf(copy);

        // This should be avoided too, because it has the same effect
        printWrapper(copy);

        // This is fine
        printf("%s", copy);
    }
