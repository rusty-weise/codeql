`Click to see the query in the CodeQL
repository <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-121/UnterminatedVarargsCall.ql>`__

The program calls a function that expects the variable argument list to
be terminated with a sentinel value (typically NULL, 0 or -1). In this
case, the sentinel value has been omitted as a final argument. This
defect may result in incorrect behavior of the function and unintended
stack memory access, leading to incorrect program results, instability,
and even vulnerability to buffer overflow style attacks.

Recommendation
--------------

Each description of a defect highlighted by this rule includes a
suggested value for the terminator. Check that this value is correct,
then add it to the end of the call.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    #include <stdarg.h>

    void pushStrings(char *firstString, ...)
    {
        va_list args;
        char *arg;

        va_start(args, firstString);

        // process inputs, beginning with firstString, ending when NULL is reached
        arg = firstString;
        while (arg != NULL)
        {
            // push the string
            pushString(arg);
        
            // move on to the next input
            arg = va_arg(args, char *);
        }

        va_end(args);
    }

    void badFunction()
    {
        pushStrings("hello", "world", NULL); // OK
        
        pushStrings("apple", "pear", "banana", NULL); // OK

        pushStrings("car", "bus", "train"); // BAD, not terminated with the expected NULL
    }

In this example, the third call to ``pushStrings`` is not correctly
terminated. This call should be updated to include ``NULL`` as the
fourth and final argument to this call.
