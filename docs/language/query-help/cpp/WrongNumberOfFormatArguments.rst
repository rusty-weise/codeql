Each call to the ``printf`` function, or a related function, should
include the number of arguments defined by the format. Passing the
function more arguments than required is harmless (although it may be
indicative of other defects). However, passing the function fewer
arguments than are defined by the format can be a security vulnerability
since the function will process the next item on the stack as the
missing arguments.

This might lead to an information leak if a sensitive value from the
stack is printed. It might cause a crash if a value on the stack is
interpreted as a pointer and leads to accessing unmapped memory.
Finally, it may lead to a follow-on vulnerability if an attacker can use
this problem to cause the output string to be too long or have
unexpected contents.

Recommendation
--------------

Review the format and arguments expected by the highlighted function
calls. Update either the format or the arguments so that the expected
number of arguments are passed to the function.

Example
-------

.. code:: cpp

    int main() {
      printf("%d, %s\n", 42); // Will crash or print garbage
      return 0;
    }
