Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an
attacker who gains access to the storage.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being
stored, especially before writing to a file. It may be wise to encrypt
information before it is put into a buffer that may be readable in
memory.

In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is
necessary for it to be used in cleartext.

Example
-------

The following example shows two ways of storing user credentials in a
file. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in cleartext.
In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are encrypted before storing them.

.. code:: c

    void writeCredentials() {
      char *password = "cleartext password";
      FILE* file = fopen("credentials.txt", "w");
      
      // BAD: write password to disk in cleartext
      fputs(password, file);
      
      // GOOD: encrypt password first
      char *encrypted = encrypt(password);
      fputs(encrypted, file);
    }
