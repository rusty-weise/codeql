This rule finds calls to functions that are dangerous to use. Currently,
it checks for calls to ``gmtime``, ``localtime``, ``ctime`` and
``asctime``.

The time related functions such as ``gmtime`` fill data into a ``tm``
struct or ``char`` array in shared memory and then returns a pointer to
that memory. If the function is called from multiple places in the same
program, and especially if it is called from multiple threads in the
same program, then the calls will overwrite each other's data.

Recommendation
--------------

Replace calls to ``gmtime`` with ``gmtime_r``. With ``gmtime_r``, the
application code manages allocation of the ``tm`` struct. That way,
separate calls to the function can use their own storage.

Similarly replace calls to ``localtime`` with ``localtime_r``, calls to
``ctime`` with ``ctime_r`` and calls to ``asctime`` with ``asctime_r``.

Example
-------

The following example checks the local time in two ways:

.. code:: c

    // BAD: using gmtime
    int is_morning_bad() {
        const time_t now_seconds = time(NULL);
        struct tm *now = gmtime(&now_seconds);
        return (now->tm_hour < 12);
    }

    // GOOD: using gmtime_r
    int is_morning_good() {
        const time_t now_seconds = time(NULL);
        struct tm now;
        gmtime_r(&now_seconds, &now);
        return (now.tm_hour < 12);
    }

The first version uses ``gmtime``, so it is vulnerable to its data being
overwritten by another thread. Even if this code is not used in a
multi-threaded context right now, future changes may make the program
multi-threaded. The second version of the code uses ``gmtime_r``. Since
it allocates a new ``tm`` struct on every call, it is immune to other
calls to ``gmtime`` or ``gmtime_r``.
