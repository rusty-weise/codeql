`Click to see the query in the CodeQL
repository <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-253/HResultBooleanConversion.ql>`__

This query indicates that an ``HRESULT`` is being cast to a Boolean type
or vice versa.

The typical success value (``S_OK``) of an ``HRESULT`` equals 0.
However, 0 indicates failure for a Boolean type.

Casting an ``HRESULT`` to a Boolean type and then using it in a test
expression will yield an incorrect result.

Recommendation
--------------

To check if a call that returns an ``HRESULT`` succeeded use the
``FAILED`` macro.

Example
-------

In the following example, ``HRESULT`` is used in a test expression
incorrectly as it may yield an incorrect result.

.. code:: cpp

    LPMALLOC pMalloc;
    HRESULT hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);

    if (!hr)
    {
        // code ...
    }

To fix this issue, use the ``FAILED`` macro in the test expression.
