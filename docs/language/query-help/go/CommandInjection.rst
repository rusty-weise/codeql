If a system command invocation is built from user-provided data without
sufficient sanitization, a malicious user may be able to run commands to
exfiltrate data or compromise the system.

Recommendation
--------------

If possible, use hard-coded string literals to specify the command to
run. Instead of interpreting user input directly as command names,
examine the input and then choose among hard-coded string literals.

If this is not possible, then add sanitization code to verify that the
user input is safe before using it.

Example
-------

In the following example, assume the function ``handler`` is an HTTP
request handler in a web application, whose parameter ``req`` contains
the request object:

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
        "net/http"
        "os/exec"
    )

    func handler(req *http.Request) {
        cmdName := req.URL.Query()["cmd"][0]
        cmd := exec.Command(cmdName)
        cmd.Run()
    }

The handler extracts the name of a system command from the request
object, and then runs it without any further checks, which can cause a
command-injection vulnerability.
