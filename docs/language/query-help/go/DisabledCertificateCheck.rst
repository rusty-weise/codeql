The field ``InsecureSkipVerify`` controls whether a TLS client verifies
the server's certificate chain and host name. If set to ``true``, the
client will accept any certificate and any host name in that
certificate, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Recommendation
--------------

Do not set ``InsecureSkipVerify`` to ``true`` except in tests.

Example
-------

The following code snippet shows a function that performs an HTTP
request over TLS with certificate verification disabled:

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
        "crypto/tls"
        "net/http"
    )

    func doAuthReq(authReq *http.Request) *http.Response {
        tr := &http.Transport{
            TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true},
        }
        client := &http.Client{Transport: tr}
        res, _ := client.Do(authReq)
        return res
    }

While this is acceptable in a test, it should not be used in production
code. Instead, certificates should be configured such that verification
can be performed.
