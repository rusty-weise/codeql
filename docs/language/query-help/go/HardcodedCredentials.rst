Including unencrypted hard-coded authentication credentials in source
code is dangerous because the credentials may be easily discovered. For
example, the code may be open source, or it may be leaked or
accidentally revealed, making the credentials visible to an attacker.
This, in turn, might enable them to gain unauthorized access, or to
obtain privileged information.

Recommendation
--------------

Remove hard-coded credentials, such as user names, passwords and
certificates, from source code. Instead, place them in configuration
files, environment variables or other data stores if necessary. If
possible, store configuration files including credential data separately
from the source code, in a secure location with restricted access.

Example
-------

The following code example connects to a Postgres database using the
``lib/pq`` package and hard-codes user name and password:

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
        "database/sql"
        "fmt"

        _ "github.com/lib/pq"
    )

    const (
        user     = "dbuser"
        password = "s3cretp4ssword"
    )

    func connect() *sql.DB {
        connStr := fmt.Sprintf("postgres://%s:%s@localhost/pqgotest", user, password)
        db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
        if err != nil {
            return nil
        }
        return db
    }

Instead, user name and password can be supplied through the environment
variables ``PGUSER`` and ``PGPASSWORD``, which can be set externally
without hard-coding credentials in the source code.
