URLs with the special scheme ``javascript`` can be used to encode
JavaScript code to be executed when the URL is visited. While this is a
powerful mechanism for creating feature-rich and responsive web
applications, it is also a potential security risk: if the URL comes
from an untrusted source, it might contain harmful JavaScript code. For
this reason, many frameworks and libraries first check the URL scheme of
any untrusted URL, and reject URLs with the ``javascript`` scheme.

However, the ``data`` and ``vbscript`` schemes can be used to represent
executable code in a very similar way, so any validation logic that
checks against ``javascript``, but not against ``data`` and
``vbscript``, is likely to be insufficient.

Recommendation
--------------

Add checks covering both ``data:`` and ``vbscript:``.

Example
-------

The following function validates a (presumably untrusted) URL
``urlstr``. If its scheme is ``javascript``, the harmless placeholder
URL ``about:blank`` is returned to prevent code injection; otherwise
``urlstr`` itself is returned.

.. code:: go

    package main

    import "net/url"

    func sanitizeUrl(urlstr string) string {
        u, err := url.Parse(urlstr)
        if err != nil || u.Scheme == "javascript" {
            return "about:blank"
        }
        return urlstr
    }

While this check provides partial projection, it should be extended to
cover ``data`` and ``vbscript`` as well:

.. code:: go

    package main

    import "net/url"

    func sanitizeUrlGod(urlstr string) string {
        u, err := url.Parse(urlstr)
        if err != nil || u.Scheme == "javascript" || u.Scheme == "data" || u.Scheme == "vbscript" {
            return "about:blank"
        }
        return urlstr
    }
