Directly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to
an HTTP response without properly sanitizing the input first, allows for
a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

This kind of vulnerability is also called *reflected* cross-site
scripting, to distinguish it from other types of cross-site scripting.

Recommendation
--------------

To guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output
encoding/escaping before writing user input to the response, or one of
the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.

Example
-------

The following example code writes part of an HTTP request (which is
controlled by the user) directly to the response. This leaves the
website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
    )

    func serve() {
        http.HandleFunc("/user", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            r.ParseForm()
            username := r.Form.Get("username")
            if !isValidUsername(username) {
                // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into the response
                fmt.Fprintf(w, "%q is an unknown user", username)
            } else {
                // TODO: do something exciting
            }
        })
        http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    }

Sanitizing the user-controlled data prevents the vulnerability:

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "html"
        "net/http"
    )

    func serve1() {
        http.HandleFunc("/user", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            r.ParseForm()
            username := r.Form.Get("username")
            if !isValidUsername(username) {
                // GOOD: a request parameter is escaped before being put into the response
                fmt.Fprintf(w, "%q is an unknown user", html.EscapeString(username))
            } else {
                // TODO: do something exciting
            }
        })
        http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    }
