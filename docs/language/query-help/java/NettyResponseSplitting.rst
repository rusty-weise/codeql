Directly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to
an HTTP header can lead to an HTTP response-splitting vulnerability. If
the user input includes blank lines in it, and if the servlet container
does not itself escape the blank lines, then a remote user can cause the
response to turn into two separate responses, one of which is controlled
by the remote user.

Recommendation
--------------

Guard against HTTP header splitting in the same way as guarding against
cross-site scripting. Before passing any data into HTTP headers, either
check the data for special characters, or escape any special characters
that are present.

Example
-------

The following example shows the 'name' parameter being written to a
cookie in two different ways. The first way writes it directly to the
cookie, and thus is vulnerable to response-splitting attacks. The second
way first removes all special characters, thus avoiding the potential
problem.

.. code:: java

    public class ResponseSplitting extends HttpServlet {
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
            // BAD: setting a cookie with an unvalidated parameter
            Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", request.getParameter("name"));
            response.addCookie(cookie);

            // GOOD: remove special characters before putting them in the header
            String name = removeSpecial(request.getParameter("name"));
            Cookie cookie2 = new Cookie("name", name);
            response.addCookie(cookie2);
        }

        private static String removeSpecial(String str) {
            return str.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z ]", "");
        }
    }

Example
-------

The following example shows the use of the library 'netty' with HTTP
response-splitting verification configurations. The second way will
verify the parameters before using them to build the HTTP response.

.. code:: java

    import io.netty.handler.codec.http.DefaultHttpHeaders;

    public class ResponseSplitting {
        // BAD: Disables the internal response splitting verification
        private final DefaultHttpHeaders badHeaders = new DefaultHttpHeaders(false);

        // GOOD: Verifies headers passed don't contain CRLF characters
        private final DefaultHttpHeaders goodHeaders = new DefaultHttpHeaders();

        // BAD: Disables the internal response splitting verification
        private final DefaultHttpResponse badResponse = new DefaultHttpResponse(version, httpResponseStatus, false);

        // GOOD: Verifies headers passed don't contain CRLF characters
        private final DefaultHttpResponse goodResponse = new DefaultHttpResponse(version, httpResponseStatus);
    }
