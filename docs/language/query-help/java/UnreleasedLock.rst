When a thread acquires a lock it must make sure to unlock it again;
failing to do so can lead to deadlocks. If a lock allows a thread to
acquire it multiple times, for example
``java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock``, then the number of locks
must match the number of unlocks in order to fully release the lock.

Recommendation
--------------

It is recommended practice always to immediately follow a call to
``lock`` with a ``try`` block and place the call to ``unlock`` inside
the ``finally`` block. Beware of calls inside the ``finally`` block that
could cause exceptions, as this may result in skipping the call to
``unlock``.

Example
-------

The typical pattern for using locks safely looks like this:

.. code:: java

    public void m() {
       lock.lock();
       // A
       try {
          // ... method body
       } finally {
          // B
          lock.unlock();
       }
    }

If any code that can cause a premature method exit (for example by
throwing an exception) is inserted at either point ``A`` or ``B`` then
the method might not unlock, so this should be avoided.
