Even when the components of a SQL query are not fully controlled by a
user, it is a vulnerability to concatenate those components into a SQL
query without neutralizing special characters. Perhaps a separate
vulnerability will allow the user to gain control of the component. As
well, a user who cannot gain full control of an input might influence it
enough to cause the SQL query to fail to run.

Recommendation
--------------

Usually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a
complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can
include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the
SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each
time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be
supplied for each wildcard in the query.

In the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with
parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A
Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part
of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when
run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by
a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer
position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for
each parameter in the query, using the ``setParameter`` method.
Specifying the query using the ``@NamedQuery`` annotation introduces an
additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal,
preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to
fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional
parameters.

It is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query
parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying
parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are
directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry
about quoting and escaping.

Example
-------

In the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two
different ways.

The first way involves building a query, ``query1``, by concatenating
the result of ``getCategory`` with some string literals. The result of
``getCategory`` can include special characters, or it might be
refactored later so that it may return something that contains special
characters.

The second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query,
``query2``, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard
(``?``). The wildcard is then given a value by calling ``setString``.
This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special
characters in the result of ``getCategory`` are not given any special
treatment.

.. code:: java

    {
        // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it
        String category = getCategory();
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        String query1 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='"
            + category + "' ORDER BY PRICE";
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a prepared query
        String category = getCategory();
        String query2 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE";
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);
        statement.setString(1, category);
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();
    }
