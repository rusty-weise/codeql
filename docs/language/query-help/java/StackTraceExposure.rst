Software developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a
debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the
developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the
problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about
the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the
final state of the software when the error occurred.

Unfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The
sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the
application as well as any internal components it relies on.
Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include
information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the
application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent
injection attack.

Recommendation
--------------

Send the user a more generic error message that reveals less
information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on
the server.

Example
-------

In the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways.
In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the
remote user using the ``sendError()`` method. As such, the user is able
to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.
In the second version, the error message is logged only on the server.
That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but
remote users will not see the information.

.. code:: java

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        try {
            doSomeWork();
        } catch (NullPointerException ex) {
            // BAD: printing a stack trace back to the response
            ex.printStackTrace(response.getWriter());
            return;
        }

        try {
            doSomeWork();
        } catch (NullPointerException ex) {
            // GOOD: log the stack trace, and send back a non-revealing response
            log("Exception occurred", ex);
            response.sendError(
                HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
                "Exception occurred");
            return;
        }
    }
