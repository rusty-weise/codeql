An integer multiplication that is assigned to a variable of type
``long`` or returned from a method with return type ``long`` may cause
unexpected arithmetic overflow.

Recommendation
--------------

Casting to type ``long`` before multiplying reduces the risk of
arithmetic overflow.

Example
-------

In the following example, the multiplication expression assigned to
``j`` causes overflow and results in the value ``-1651507200`` instead
of ``4000000000000000000``.

.. code:: java

    int i = 2000000000;
    long j = i*i; // causes overflow

In the following example, the assignment to ``k`` correctly avoids
overflow by casting one of the operands to type ``long``.

.. code:: java

    int i = 2000000000;
    long k = i*(long)i; // avoids overflow
