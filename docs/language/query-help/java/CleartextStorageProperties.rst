Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an
attacker who gains access to the storage.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being
stored. It may be wise to encrypt information before it is put into a
heap data structure (such as ``Java.util.Properties``) that may be
written to disk later. Objects that are serializable or marshallable
should also always contain encrypted information unless you are certain
that they are not ever going to be serialized.

In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is
necessary for it to be used in cleartext.

Example
-------

The following example shows two ways of storing user credentials in a
cookie. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in
cleartext. In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are hashed before storing
them.

.. code:: java

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        {
            String data;
            PasswordAuthentication credentials =
                    new PasswordAuthentication("user", "BP@ssw0rd".toCharArray());
            data = credentials.getUserName() + ":" + new String(credentials.getPassword());
        
            // BAD: store data in a cookie in cleartext form
            response.addCookie(new Cookie("auth", data));
        }
        
        {
            String data;
            PasswordAuthentication credentials =
                    new PasswordAuthentication("user", "GP@ssw0rd".toCharArray());
            String salt = "ThisIsMySalt";
            MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");
            messageDigest.reset();
            String credentialsToHash =
                    credentials.getUserName() + ":" + credentials.getPassword();
            byte[] hashedCredsAsBytes =
                    messageDigest.digest((salt+credentialsToHash).getBytes("UTF-8"));
            data = bytesToString(hashedCredsAsBytes);
            
            // GOOD: store data in a cookie in encrypted form
            response.addCookie(new Cookie("auth", data));
        }
    }
