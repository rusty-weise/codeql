Using unvalidated input as part of an index into the array can cause the
array access to throw an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException``. This is
because there is no guarantee that the index provided is within the
bounds of the array.

This problem occurs when user input is used as an array index, either
directly or following one or more calculations. If the user input is
unsanitized, it may be any value, which could result in either a
negative index, or an index which is larger than the size of the array,
either of which would result in an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException``.

Recommendation
--------------

The index used in the array access should be checked against the bounds
of the array before being used. The index should be smaller than the
array size, and it should not be negative.

Example
-------

The following program accesses an element from a fixed size constant
array:

.. code:: java

    public class ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex extends HttpServlet {

      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
        String[] productDescriptions = new String[] { "Chocolate bar", "Fizzy drink" };

        // User provided value
        String productID = request.getParameter("productID");
        try {
            int productID = Integer.parseInt(userProperty.trim());

            /*
             * BAD Array is accessed without checking if the user provided value is out of
             * bounds.
             */
            String productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];

            if (productID >= 0 && productID < productDescriptions.length) {
              // GOOD We have checked that the array index is valid first
              productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];
            } else {
              productDescription = "No product for that ID";
            }

            response.getWriter().write(productDescription);

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }
      }
    }

The first access of the ``productDescriptions`` array uses the
user-provided value as the index without performing any checks. If the
user provides a negative value, or a value larger than the size of the
array, then an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` may be thrown.

The second access of the ``productDescriptions`` array is contained
within a conditional expression that verifies the user-provided value is
a valid index into the array. This ensures that the access operation
never throws an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException``.
