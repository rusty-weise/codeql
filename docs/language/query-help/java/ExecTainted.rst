Code that passes user input directly to ``Runtime.exec``, or some other
library routine that executes a command, allows the user to execute
malicious code.

Recommendation
--------------

If possible, use hard-coded string literals to specify the command to
run or library to load. Instead of passing the user input directly to
the process or library function, examine the user input and then choose
among hard-coded string literals.

If the applicable libraries or commands cannot be determined at compile
time, then add code to verify that the user input string is safe before
using it.

Example
-------

The following example shows code that takes a shell script that can be
changed maliciously by a user, and passes it straight to
``Runtime.exec`` without examining it first.

.. code:: java

    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String script = System.getenv("SCRIPTNAME");
            if (script != null) {
                // BAD: The script to be executed is controlled by the user.
                Runtime.getRuntime().exec(script);
            }
        }
    }
