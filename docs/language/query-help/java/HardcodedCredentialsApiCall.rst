Including unencrypted hard-coded authentication credentials in source
code is dangerous because the credentials may be easily discovered. For
example, the code may be open source, or it may be leaked or
accidentally revealed, making the credentials visible to an attacker.
This, in turn, might enable them to gain unauthorized access, or to
obtain privileged information.

Recommendation
--------------

Remove hard-coded credentials, such as user names, passwords and
certificates, from source code. Instead, place them in configuration
files, environment variables or other data stores if necessary. If
possible, store configuration files including credential data separately
from the source code, in a secure location with restricted access.

Example
-------

The following code example connects to a database using a hard-coded
user name and password:

.. code:: java

    private static final String p = "123456"; // hard-coded credential

    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test";
        String u = "admin"; // hard-coded credential

        getConn(url, u, p);
    }

    public static void getConn(String url, String v, String q) throws SQLException {
        DriverManager.getConnection(url, v, q); // sensitive call
    }

Instead, the user name and password could be supplied through
environment variables, which can be set externally without hard-coding
credentials in the source code.
