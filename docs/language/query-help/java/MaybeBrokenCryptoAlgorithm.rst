Using broken or weak cryptographic algorithms can leave data vulnerable
to being decrypted.

Many cryptographic algorithms provided by cryptography libraries are
known to be weak, or flawed. Using such an algorithm means that an
attacker may be able to easily decrypt the encrypted data.

Recommendation
--------------

Ensure that you use a strong, modern cryptographic algorithm. Use at
least AES-128 or RSA-2048.

Example
-------

The following code shows an example of using a java ``Cipher`` to
encrypt some data. When creating a ``Cipher`` instance, you must specify
the encryption algorithm to use. The first example uses DES, which is an
older algorithm that is now considered weak. The second example uses
AES, which is a strong modern algorithm.

.. code:: java

    // BAD: DES is a weak algorithm 
    Cipher des = Cipher.getInstance("DES");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec);

    byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes("UTF-8"));

    // ...

    // GOOD: AES is a strong algorithm
    Cipher des = Cipher.getInstance("AES");

    // ...
