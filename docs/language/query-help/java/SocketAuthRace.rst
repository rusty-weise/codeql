A common pattern is to have a channel of communication open with a user,
and then to open another channel, for example to transfer data. However,
if user authentication is done over the original channel rather than the
alternate channel, then an attacker may be able to connect to the
alternate channel before the legitimate user does. This allows the
attacker to impersonate the user by "piggybacking" on any previous
authentication.

Recommendation
--------------

When opening an alternate channel for an authenticated user (for
example, a Java ``Socket``), always authenticate the user over the new
channel.

Example
-------

This example shows two ways of opening a connection for a user. In the
first example, authentication is determined based on materials that the
user has already provided (for example, their username and/or password),
and then a new channel is opened. However, no authentication is done
over the new channel, and so an attacker could connect to it before the
user connects.

In the second example, authentication is done over the socket channel
itself, which verifies that the newly connected user is in fact the user
that was expected.

.. code:: java

    public void doConnect(int desiredPort, String username) {
        ServerSocket listenSocket = new ServerSocket(desiredPort);

        if (isAuthenticated(username)) {
            Socket connection1 = listenSocket.accept();
            // BAD: no authentication over the socket connection
            connection1.getOutputStream().write(secretData);
        }
    }

    public void doConnect(int desiredPort, String username) {
        ServerSocket listenSocket = new ServerSocket(desiredPort);

        Socket connection2 = listenSocket.accept();
        // GOOD: authentication happens over the socket
        if (doAuthenticate(connection2, username)) {
            connection2.getOutputStream().write(secretData);
        }
    }
