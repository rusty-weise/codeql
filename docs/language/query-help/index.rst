CodeQL query help
-----------------

Use the sidebar to view the query help for the queries included in the "code scanning" and "security extended" query suites for a single language.

Each query help page includes: 

- A summary of key metadata for the query
- A link to the query in the `CodeQL repository <https://github.com/gitub/codeql>`__
- Help information to explain what potential vulnerability the query identifies and a recommendation for how to avoid introducing the problem in your code
